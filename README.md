SocketTest Note
===
This project is just for an experiment about using Socket to send the message in Unity, and I watched the vedio below the **Ref** to learn how to set up server and client.  
     
And I also use the result in other project like **「MiniMap」**, it really useful to construct a multi-player game.

- Change the port(*int*) in ***Server.cs*** and  port(*int*)&host(*string*) in ***Client.cs***
- both port(*int*) need to be same

In this project, I just use the message(input a number) from ***Client.exe*** to instantiate the correspond number of object.
